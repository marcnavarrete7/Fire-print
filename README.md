# 🛰️ MaAI IAAC Satellite-Based Wildfires Vegetation Loss Analysis (Case Study: Evia Wildfires 2017–2023)

This notebook provides a geospatial workflow for assessing vegetation loss due to wildfires using satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques. While Evia, Greece is used as a case study, the methodology can be applied to other regions globally.

## 🔍 Overview

- Google Earth Engine & `geemap` for satellite data access and visualization  
- NDVI-based pre/post fire comparison  
- Multi-year temporal analysis (2017–2023)  
- Interactive mapping of burned areas

## 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries:
  - `geemap`
  - `earthengine-api`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `folium`

Install via:

```bash
pip install geemap earthengine-api matplotlib pandas folium
```

Also requires a Google Earth Engine account:
